				Sea turtles, with streamlined bodies and distinctive shells, inhabit oceans globally, feeding primarily
				on marine plants and animals. Females return to birth beaches to lay eggs in sand nests, leaving
				hatchlings to navigate to the sea independently. Threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and poaching,
				they require urgent conservation efforts for survival.</p>
